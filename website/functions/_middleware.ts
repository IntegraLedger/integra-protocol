/**
 * Canonical host enforcement.
 *
 * The Pages project answers on the canonical host and on its `.pages.dev` alias, which would
 * otherwise be two independently indexable copies of the same site, each declaring the other's
 * canonical. This folds the alias into the canonical host with a permanent 301, preserving path
 * and query. It has to live here: the alias is on Cloudflare's zone, not ours, so no redirect
 * rule on `integraledger.com` can reach it.
 *
 * Preview deployments (`<hash>.integra-protocol.pages.dev`) and local dev are matched exactly,
 * NOT by suffix, so they keep working untouched.
 *
 * The fold is armed by `CANONICAL_HOST_ATTACHED` in wrangler.toml, and it ships `"false"`: the
 * subdomain in `siteConfig.url` is a placeholder that has not been ruled, and a 301 to a host
 * that does not answer would take the alias — today the only host that answers — down with it.
 * Rule the host, attach it, confirm it returns 200, then flip the var and redeploy. See
 * README.md "Deploying".
