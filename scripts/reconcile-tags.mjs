/**
 * Reconcile git tags against what is actually published, independently of HOW a release was approved.
 *
 * ⛔⛔ THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR, AND THIS IS THE REPOSITORY IT HAPPENED TO. Tagging lives inside
 * `approve-staged.mjs`, so it happens only when a maintainer approves a release by running that script.
 * Approving in the **npm web UI** is the same 2FA proof-of-presence and is a perfectly reasonable thing
 * to do — and it never reaches the script, so the repository goes untagged with nothing reporting it.
 * **Five consecutive releases went out that way: 0.12.0 through 0.13.0, 155 tags.** That looked like a
 * bug in the tagging code for a long time, and was not — the code was simply never reached. The tags
 * were reconstructed by hand from provenance on 2026-08-26; this exists so it is never hand work again.
 *
 * ⚠️ `approve-staged.mjs` still tags, and should: tagging at approval time is the cheapest moment to do
 * it. This is the backstop for every other path, not a replacement.
 *
 * ⭐ A step that only runs on one of several legitimate paths is not a step, it is a coincidence. This
 * script derives the answer from the two sources that are true regardless of path — the registry, and
 * each version's own SLSA provenance — so it is correct after a script approval, a web approval, or a
 * publish nobody remembers.
 *
 *   node scripts/reconcile-tags.mjs            report; exit 1 if any published version is untagged
 *   node scripts/reconcile-tags.mjs --write    additionally create and push the missing tags
 *
 * ⚠️ NEEDS NO NPM AUTH. Provenance and the packument are public reads. `--write` needs push rights for
 * tags and nothing else, which is why the workflow that runs it grants `contents: write` on that job
 * alone rather than at the top level.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO FALLBACK TO HEAD, ever. A version whose provenance cannot be read is REPORTED, never guessed at.
 * An untagged release is visibly missing; a mis-tagged one is a wrong answer that reads as a right one.
