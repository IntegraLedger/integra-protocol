/**
 * Hold every PUBLISHED package against the source at the SAME version, BY CONTENT.
 *
 * ★ INSTALLED WHILE THIS TREE IS CLEAN, AND THAT IS THE ARGUMENT FOR IT. `M` 2026-09-14: all 31 publishable
 * packages here match their published artifacts byte for byte. A gate installed on a clean subject has a
 * green that MEANS something — its first red is a new regression. A gate installed on a drifted subject is
 * permanently red until someone cuts a release, and its green only ever says "the known backlog is still
 * there". The clean moment is the rare one and it does not come back once a repository drifts.
 *
 * ⛔ WHAT IT WATCHES FOR, measured in the sibling repository rather than imagined here. In
 * `integra-agentic-terms`, `packages/agentic-terms/src/x402-envelope.ts` is tracked on `main`, exported, and
 * ABSENT from the published `0.17.0` tarball — while the source `package.json` also reads `0.17.0`. The work
 * landed four and a half hours AFTER that version published. Source and registry agreed on the version
 * string and disagreed on the bytes, and every gate in that repository stayed green: its `check:dist` built
 * from correct source, its runtime smoke packs the working tree, and its tag reconciliation asks whether
 * published versions are TAGGED rather than CURRENT. Six defects across two packages, and nothing saw them.
 *
 * ★ SAME VERSION MUST MEAN SAME CONTENT. A version number is a promise about bytes.
 *
 * ⛔ AND IT COMPARES HASHES, NOT FILENAMES. A filename check saw ONE of the six defects in that sibling: one
 * file was absent and five were PRESENT WITH DIFFERENT BYTES. Editing a published file without a bump is the
 * commoner shape and is exactly the one a name-only comparison cannot see.
 *
 * ## ⛔ THE STATED LIMITS, ANNOUNCED RATHER THAN HIDDEN
 *
 * Only files under a declared SOURCE directory are compared. `dist/` is build output: comparing it would
 * require reproducing the exact toolchain of whatever machine published, and a mismatch would be a finding
 * about build determinism rather than drift. A package shipping `dist` alone is reported NOT COMPARABLE
 * rather than silently passing — an unmeasured package must never read as a clean one.
 *
 * ⛔ A SHRINKING SUBJECT SET IS THE FAILURE THIS GATE IS MOST LIKELY TO DIE OF, so it carries a FLOOR.
 * Dropping `src` from a package's `files` — an ordinary "stop shipping source" edit — would turn that
 * package into a NOT COMPARABLE note while the rest compared green, and the run would exit 0 over the
 * absence of the subject that mattered.
 *
 * ⛔ AN UNREACHABLE REGISTRY IS A FAULT, never "in parity" — and A FAULT IS NOT DRIFT. Exit 3 says the
 * instrument failed; exit 1 says an artifact is behind. Filing the second over the first asserts a defect
 * nobody measured.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS A SECOND COPY OF THE SIBLING REPOSITORY'S GATE, and that is a known cost rather than an
 * oversight. The two repositories share no package, so sharing the logic would mean publishing one, and that
 * is a decision nobody has taken. Until it is, the copies are independent and may drift; the drive is what
 * keeps this one honest.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node scripts/check-published-parity.mjs
 *
 * ⚠️ `INTEGRA_PARITY_ROOT` and `INTEGRA_PARITY_ORIGIN` exist so the drive can run THIS FILE as a process
 * against a fixture tree and a local registry, and assert the exit CODES rather than the return values — the
 * workflow reads the process's code, and a drive that only checks return values does not span that join.

 * \u26d4\u26d4 THE ARCHIVE IS NEVER EXTRACTED TO DISK, AND THAT IS A SECURITY PROPERTY RATHER THAN A STYLE CHOICE.

 * A first draft wrote the downloaded tarball to a temp directory and shelled out to `tar xzf`. GitHub's
 * CodeQL flagged it on the pull request \u2014 *"network data written to file: write to file system depends on
 * untrusted data"* \u2014 and it was right. A registry tarball is externally controlled input, and extracting
 * one is a path-traversal and symlink-escape surface: an entry named `../../x`, an absolute path, or a
 * symlink followed by a later entry can place bytes outside the directory the caller chose. That modern GNU
 * tar strips most of those is a property of the tool that happened to be on the box, not of this code.
 *
 * \u2b50 So the tar is walked in memory and only REGULAR FILE entries are hashed. Nothing is written, nothing is
 * executed, and a hostile entry name can at worst appear as a key in a Map that is then compared against a
 * list of names this repository already declared. The traversal class is not mitigated; it is absent.
 *
 * The format is POSIX ustar: 512-byte header, `size` as octal at offset 124, content padded to 512.
 * Type `0` or NUL is a regular file; `x`/`g` are pax metadata and `L` is a GNU long name, whose payloads are
