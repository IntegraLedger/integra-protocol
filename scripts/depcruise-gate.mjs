/**
 * Run dependency-cruiser AND refuse a vacuous cruise — the blind-gate canary.
 *
 * The architecture gate has gone silently blind twice, exit 0 both times: the tsc parser cruises ZERO
 * modules under TS 7, and a missing `enhancedResolveOptions` leaves every `^packages/…` path rule matching
 * nothing (both are documented in `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`, but a comment cannot fail a build). A gate
 * that inspects nothing reports nothing to violate, so "no violations" alone proves the rules held OR the
 * gate is blind — indistinguishable. This wrapper closes that: it asserts the cruise actually SAW the
 * workspace before believing its verdict.
 *
 * The floor is deliberately far below the real count (618 modules on 2026-08-07) and far above zero: it
 * trips on blindness, never on refactoring. Raise it if the workspace grows; never delete it.
